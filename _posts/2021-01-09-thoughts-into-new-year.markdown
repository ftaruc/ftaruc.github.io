According to Google, an `expectation` is

> a strong belief that something will happen or be the case in the future.

We set resolutions in a new year hoping that our behavior will change in accordance with them. Whether it's fitness goals or exploring new hobbies, inconsistencies after the 'honeymoon' phase will revert people's behaviors back to what is comfortable.

Consequently, I learned that if I really want to grow, I have to be *stricter* on myself.

> Some current <s>goals</s> **expectations** placed for 2021:

* Learn how to create interactive dashboards through Shiny (R*) or Bokeh (Python), and learn which KPI's are important to certain contexts/stakeholders (whether focusing on sales, margins, volumes and conversions -- or the performance of a products in different regions). Dashboards can also provide fun infographs, i.e: Charlie Thompson's [Sentify](http://www.rcharlie.net/sentify/), which uses RShiny to create interactive dashboards of Spotify's valence and energy metadata.

* Re-learn statistical, ML, and AI theory  for interviews. Some online textbooks that I will continue to link as I find more resources: [forecasting](https://otexts.com/fpp2/), etc.

* Become a [full-stack python](https://www.fullstackpython.com/) developer, namely to learn [web development](https://www.fullstackpython.com/web-development.html) and then [deploying web applications](https://www.fullstackpython.com/deployment.html) to present models I built through projects.

* Be employed as a data analyst, and continue to grow in my free time to transition into becoming a data scientist.

Let's see what this year brings us.
