*Re-imagining data* -- this website is dedicated to transparent discussions on the broad field of data science and analytics in today's data bubble. I'll be sharing my own personal projects and will be blogging about new topics I have learned throughout the year.

> Some **current goals** set for 2021:

* Learn how to create interactive dashboards through Shiny (R*) or Bokeh (Python), and learn which KPI's are important to certain contexts/stakeholders (whether focusing on sales, margins, volumes and conversions -- or the performance of a products in different regions). Dashboards can also provide fun infographs, i.e: Charlie Thompson's [Sentify](http://www.rcharlie.net/sentify/), which uses RShiny to create interactive dashboards of Spotify's valence and energy metadata.

* Re-learn statistical, ML, and AI theory  for interviews. Some online textbooks that I will continue to link as I find more resources: [forecasting](https://otexts.com/fpp2/), etc.

* Become a [full-stack python](https://www.fullstackpython.com/) developer, namely to learn [web development](https://www.fullstackpython.com/web-development.html) and then [deploying web applications](https://www.fullstackpython.com/deployment.html) to present models I built through projects.
