*Re-imagining data* -- this website is dedicated to transparent discussions on the broad field of data science and analytics in today's data bubble. I'll be sharing my own personal projects and will be blogging about new topics I have learned throughout the year.  <u>For inquiries</u>, email me : `ferdie@berkeley.edu`
